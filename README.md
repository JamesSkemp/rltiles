# GitHub clone of [RL Tiles](http://rltiles.sourceforge.net/) + extra work!

I wanted tiles for a roguelike game. The RL tiles are great, but I wanted a few more things:

- Transparent background
- All the 2D tiles from both its NetHack set and its Dungeon Crawl set
- Metadata of (name â†’ index) in JSON format
- Deduplication
- Decent ordering in the map (all monsters, all items, all dungeon features)

[View the interactive tileset explorer here](statico.github.io/rltiles/) and then check out `rltiles-2d.json` and `rltiles-2d.png`.
